#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
#2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
#3.   Displays the final sum.
count = 50
for i in range(1,50):
    count= count + i
print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 50", count)
